# ft_printf
This is another algorithmic project.  
It helps you getting familiar with variadic functions in C.   

Basically, you're asked to code a simplified version of the [printf function from the stdio.h library](https://linux.die.net/man/3/printf). 
The conversions you're asked to handle are "cspdiuxX%", with or without any of these flags "-.0*".

More details are available in the subject attached.  
## Getting started
This project is built on macOS, so you have to run it on a mac environment.
On your terminal, execute in the repository of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/ehafidi/ft_printf.git
cd ft_printf
make all
```
It will build and compile a library "libftprintf.a" that you can run with any C program
